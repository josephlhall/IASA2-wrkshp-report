--- abstract

This is the Workshop Report for the IETF Administrative Support Activity
2.0 (IASA 2.0) Virtual Workshops, held on 28 February 2017 at 1100 UT
and 1600 UT. The original IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) 
was created ten years ago, and since has been subject to some
reflection. In the intervening years, there has been considerable
change in the necessary tasks of IETF administration and in the world
around the IETF, and in how the IETF
raises funds and finances its work.  The IASA 2.0 process seeks to
address which administrative arrangements will best support the IETF
going forward.

Introduction {#intro}
============

The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) arrangements were created 
more than ten years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own 
administration {{RFC4071}}. In the intervening years, there has been considerable
change in the tasks of IETF administration and in the world
around the IETF {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}} and in how the IETF
raises funds and finances its work {{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.  

In 2016, IETF leadership began a discussion to review and possibly 
rework administrative arrangements at the IETF, dubbed the IETF 
Administrative Support Activity 2.0 project {{Arkko-2016}}. The 
IASA 2.0 process seeks to address what administrative arrangements 
that will best support the IETF going forward. 

To make changes, the IETF community first needs to understand the
challenges and/or missed opportunities within the current system. A
number of areas face challenges: structural and organizational issues regarding
the roles and interfaces between the IETF, the IAOC, ISOC, the IESG,
and contractors; the IETF funding model; transparency and communication issues among the many IASA moving pieces; availability of
staff, contractor, and volunteer resources compared to the
administrative workload; and internal IAOC organizational issues.

To get input from the community to identify challenges and opportunities in these
and other areas, the IETF leadership set up two virtual workshops open
to everyone in the IETF community and to people who are or have worked in
IETF-administrative roles. These virtual workshops were held on 28 
February 2017 at 11:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC. The agenda, slides, and 
minutes from the two meetings are available at the workshop proceedings 
{{IASA20-proceedings}}. Recordings of the two workshops are also 
available {{IASA20-1100UT-rec}} {{IASA20-1600UT-rec}}.

At these workshops, the participants provided
their experiences and suggestions.  Proposed changes
and solutions will be discussed and dealt with in a later phase of the
IASA 2.0 project.

Terminology and Organizational Structure {#termsorg}
========================================

Terminology {#terms}
-----------

The following acronyms will be heavily used in the discussion below:

* IASA - IETF Administrative Support Activity - An organized activity
  that provides administrative support for the IETF, the IAB and the
  IESG.

* IAOC - IETF Administrative Oversight Committee - A largely
  IETF-selected committee that oversees and directs IASA. Accountable
  to the IETF community.

* ISOC - The Internet Society - An organization that assists the IETF
  with legal, administrative, and funding tasks. 

* IAD - IETF Administrative Director - The sole staff member
  responsible for carrying out the work of the IASA. An ISOC employee.

* IETF Trust - Acquires, maintains, and licenses intellectual and
  other property used in connection with the administration of the
  IETF. Same composition as IAOC.

Organizational Structure {#org}
------------------------

In terms of organizational arrangements, the workshop chairs 
provided a diagram that captured most of the organizational relationships
among various entities {{IASA-Org-Chart}}.
In addition, the IAOC relies on a number of
committees to get its work done -- Finance, Legal Management,
Meetings, Technology Management, and RFP Committee in addition to any
ad hoc committees -- the connections between these committees and the IAD 
are not reflected in the diagram. 

Some workshop participants felt that the diagram generally reflected
reality and that it illustrated the large number of moving pieces
involved. It was pointed out that there are a lot of moving parts
compared to 11 years ago when the IASA was formed, as IASA now "owns"
certain functions that it did not at that time, such as the Secretariat and 
IETF Trust.


Issues Raised {#issues}
=============

The IASA 2.0 Virtual Workshops focused on the following areas, ordered
in terms of decreasing priority given input at the workshops.


Structural and Organizational Issues {#structure}
-----------------

Slide 10 of the slide deck {{IASA2-Workshop-Slides}} discussed the
following structural issues between the IETF, the IAOC, ISOC, the
IESG, and contractors:

* The line between the IETF and ISOC is not organizationally clear-cut, 
  which has led to issues around transparency, allocation of staff time 
  and priorities, budgeting, and clarity of who is responsible for what.
* The respective roles of ISOC, the IETF chair, the IAOC, and the secretariat 
  in representing the IETF to sponsors and donors and communicating with 
  them are not clear.
* Having ISOC represent the IETF to sponsors and donors -
    * creates confusion about why the IETF does not represent itself,
    * yields questions about why ISOC does not instead increase its IETF 
      support and how donations can be guaranteed to be dedicated to the IETF, and
    * can result in those soliciting sponsorships and donations having a lack 
      of familiarity with IETF work.

There was discussion during the virtual workshop about organizational
issues between ISOC and IETF. For example, some items that are branded
IETF, like the IETF Journal, are ISOC driven and funded, and actually
do not belong to the IETF.  It is often not clear who is doing what on
behalf of whom; a comment was made that IASA 2.0 discussions should
focus on what the *IETF* is doing. Other ISOC-funded activities
include the Ombudsteam, which was requested by IETF and should show up
in an accounting of IETF resources; and ISOC Fellows and Policy
Fellows, which are ISOC-funded and controlled programs that encourage
technical ISOC members and policy experts from developing economies to
interact with the IETF, and that should not show up in an IETF
budget. This sounded like a branding issue at times; while the IETF
Trust holds IETF trademarks, is the IETF brand and the contours of
what it encompasses clear?

A related but distinct issue arose around control and policy authority
among the various IASA components. IETF participants are confused
about who has policy authority. For example, if the IETF community
wants to change the structure of relationships with sponsors, who has
the authority to make that decision?  IESG? IAOC?  Community
consensus?  It's unclear.  Participants said that there is a gap in
terms of the IAOC being the body that carries this out.  Who defines
the contents of ISOC activities that are visible to the outside world,
like the IETF Fellows, the IETF Journal, and the lunch meetings that
are part of ISOC programming? Who decides how to drive those things?
Should those be included in the budget? How does the IAOC get its
policy instructions from the IETF community? The IAOC only goes to the
community for specific policy questions -- e.g., the privacy policy or
changes to the trust legal provisions -- but does not get general
"please do this" feedback from the community. In many cases the
"policy from the IETF community" comes through the IESG as voiced by
the IETF chair.  There was a lack of clarity around even where some
questions should be asked (e.g. "how many logos do we want on our
badges?" or "who drives/has responsibility for some specific
functions?"). An important question is whether or not the IETF
community wants a "thin" IAOC that has mostly oversight of IAD or a
"thick" IAOC that has administrative responsibilities -- i.e. "who is
driving the bus?"

In terms of accounting structure, there have been improvements to
accounting that have helped increase accuracy, and the accounting
budget has increased over the last 5 or 6 years to recognize ISOC
staff contributions, but appropriate accounting between ISOC and IETF
needs more work. It is not clear who is in the driver's seat. One
participant stated it as: "If we don't like a function, can we delete
it? or does that require IETF participation?"  Some things are very
clearly IETF topics, and then there are some that fall in between IETF
and ISOC, and then there are some that are purely ISOC. Control needs
to be aligned with accounting so IETF can decide.

On the marketing side of organization and structure issues, workshop
participants discussed how the IETF is represented to the outside
world -- donors, media, other organizations and communities -- and
some felt that it needs to be clearer, even if this is currently an
ISOC activity. People don't understand the difference between ISOC and
IETF. Maybe not number 1 priority in the sense that we have to
understand it before we can correctly communicate it.

Some felt that the lack of rigid formality in the organization and
structure was not necessarily a bad thing. Some felt that the
structure of IETF, which is not well-defined and thus flexible,
provides a benefit to the Internet. One commentor stated that given
the proclivities of engineers towards structure and formality, working
to improve IASA could make the IETF more structured and thus less
appealing to some kinds of contributors. We need clarity that
institutionalizes this level accessibility to all participants, which
will be tricky. In contrast, another participant felt that we do
ourselves a disservice by this long-standing confusion about whether
IETF is an organization; they felt that people within the community
know what is meant by the IETF and that more formality is not
necessary. The point was made that any changes to the organization of
the IETF will have practical implications, such as impacting legal
transactions, which generally go through ISOC.


Funding Issues {#funding}
--------------

Slide 12 of the slide deck {{IASA2-Workshop-Slides}} discussed the
following issues related to the IETF funding model:

* Meeting fees are currently an important source of revenue, 
  but remote participation and other factors may be responsible 
  for declining in-person meeting attendance going forward. 
  Even if fees were charged for remote participation, charging 
  the same for remote and in-person attendance is unlikely to be 
  a viable way to make up the difference.
* While there has been a lot of sponsor support for, e.g., meeting 
  hosting, getting support for the full sponsorship program is not easy. 
  The value to sponsors is not always obvious, the IETF community is 
  sometimes critical or unappreciative, and the same sponsors get 
  tapped again and again for many related but different opportunities.
* Relying heavily on meeting-based revenue is somewhat at odds 
  with the fact that much of the IETF's work takes place outside 
  of in-person meetings.
* The IETF is increasingly relying on professional services to support 
  its activities, causing expenses to grow.

Workshop participants discussed funding issues faced by the IETF,
including: increasing costs due to more tools, new hotels, etc.;
relatively flat growth in funding; meeting fees that do not cover
operating expenses so that there is increased pressure on sponsorship
and increased ISOC contributions. These funding issues are covered in
{{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.

For example, participants noted that the 2015 IETF budget seems larger
than the amount of funding IETF explicitly receives from ISOC.
Funding, from ISOC as posted in the ISOC 2015 budget was estimated
("ballpark") at $9.4M out of a total ISOC budget of $38M, but IETF
sees less than $3M. Clearly, more clarity is needed on funding.

Some workshop participants commented on how the willingness of sponsors to
fund IETF is a useful measure of the IETF's relevance. That is,
looking for sponsors is a good way to measure support in the
community. If sponsorship starts to dry up, it may be a symptom of
larger problems, that the IETF is no longer relevant or at least
becoming less relevant. The IETF needs to ensure its ongoing
relevance. The IETF needs to understand what it's offering. One
commentor stated that while it's valuable to stay in touch with the
engineers who understand how the Internet works, that may not justify
three meetings a year. It was felt that this will never line up
perfectly, but that fact doesn't take away the need for clarity.

In terms of funding sources, participants commented that it is
generally good for the IETF to have multiple sources of funding on
which to stand.  Diversity in funding sources allows IETF to shift
gears: IETF endowment can provide longer-term stability; Long-term
sponsorship, such as the Global Host program ($100k per year for 10
years, also stated as the best way to support the IETF as an
organization); meetings can be funded through fees (although
registration fees are prohibitive for many) and sponsorships. However,
explaining the need for diversity of funding is more complicated than
it needs to be. We probably need to find a simpler story.

Specifically, participants discussed a potential mismatch between the
IETF's activities and its funding model, which is mainly constituted
from meeting fees. Questions raised included: What is the right
proportion for meeting-based revenue? What are the alternative methods
to fund the non-meeting-based activities?  Sponsorships?  Do we hire
staff or contract to provide assistance?

In terms of the relative amounts of funding from sources, a commentor
mentioned that the level of funding that the IETF receives through
Global Hosts ($500K/year) is much smaller compared to the sponsorship
funding of many open-source projects, and the IETF could be getting a
lot more money through this source.

Further, in terms of sponsorship funding, it's not often a cut-and-dry
proposition, requiring a larger, more diffuse commitment than a sponsor
may originally expect. For example, meeting sponsors are also
responsible for extra work like printing T-shirts and staging social
events, and there is a lot of risk to a meeting sponsor if they get
anything wrong (presumably in terms of backlash from the community).
This aspect of logistics and event programming is an area of expertise
that few IETF participants have, so they often have to get their
marketing departments involved, for example. If sponsors could focus
on just securing the money, where someone else would worry about the
logistic problems, that would help.

There were also issues discussed with communication to potential
sponsors and funders what they are agreeing to.  The IETF needs to be able to
clearly state what it is asking for, and what the relevance is
for the potential sponsor. It's unclear now who is responsible for
communicating these messages to funding sources. It's unclear how this
outreach is done and if it is done well, especially for large
sponsors. One commentor states that it seems like there are two types
of organizations the IETF is looking for -- those involved in the
Internet ecosystem, and those interested in standards.  Honing
outreach to both of those types of organizations would be
helpful. Another commentor stated that the same sponsors are asked for
support over and over again.  Further, how are new companies sought
out and developed for potential support?  Outreach appears to be split
between the various IASA parties.  A commentor stated that when ISOC
is raising funds on behalf of the IETF, it is sub-contractor; this
needs to be clearly communicated.

Participants offered up some perspective as current and past IETF sponsors through their own organization.  One Global Host noted that they consider it unusual to fund the IETF through a third party (ISOC). This can raise approval and audit questions inside the sponsor company, and the sponsor is left guessing as to when the IETF might receive the money they contribute. Finally, this sponsor wondered if this indirect structure makes sense in the future or if can be made direct.  The structure also makes it difficult to contribute to the IETF endowment for the same issues and because there is no independent organization managing and reporting on the IETF endowment. Thus, perhaps a different level of financial and administrative separation from ISOC would be helpful for fundraising in the future, both for supporting the IETF generally and for the endowment.


Some commentors talked about what kinds of support were easier to
secure from their organizations.  An IETF participant may be more
inclined to seek, and find it easier to gain, sponsorship for easily
communicated and defined activities, for example, the Systers
Lunch. For activities like these, IETF participants may do a better
job than staffers hired to solicit funding, and we should distribute
as best as we can.



Transparency and Communication Issues {#transparency}
-------------------

Slide 9 of the slide deck {{IASA2-Workshop-Slides}} discussed the
following issues involving transparency and communication:

* IAOC has typically been perceived to operate less transparently 
  than what is the norm for IETF processes and other IETF leadership bodies.
* Lack of transparency has some roots in concerns about confidentiality 
  of contract terms and business relationships, and fear of community 
  reaction to administrative decisions.
* Requirements from the community about IAOC transparency expectations 
  are not clear.

The IAOC and IASA could better communicate with the IETF community,
some said. IASA has lagged progress of groups like IESG, who have made
agendas and meetings open.  The IETF community should document the
transparency requirement clearly, e.g., set the default to be open,
such as open meetings and materials, and publish an exception list for
confidential or sensitive matters. Hotel contracts aren't shown due to
confidentiality agreements, and there have been some arguments about
that reducing transparency of meeting deals.  Fear was identified as a
significant cause of lack of transparency.  Two potential sources of
fear were offered: making a decision that the IAOC knows the community won't
like, and having a situation where there is a Last Call and all of the
previous conversations the IAOC has had are rehashed.

With regards to IAOC communication to IETF, some
said that we could use a better understanding what needs to improve
and where it can improve. The IAOC could do better in telling the
community what it does and how it makes decisions. Now that plenary time has been shortened, the community doesn't get to see the
IAOC, and this reduces the opportunities for the community to
understand what they do. However, participants have said that they
don't want exposure to the boring details at the plenaries -- "which are
boring until they're not, and everyone is surprised."  How do we
encourage the IETF community to understand the IAOC and role of the
IASA to best reduce these poor outcomes?  At the meetings, the IAOC
could hold information sessions or office hours, to allow people to raise
concerns and ask for guidance.  This would help the community get to
know the IAOC and have people volunteer.  Some felt that the IAOC
needs to provide insight into what the IAOC is going to do, as opposed
to what it has just done.  Telegraphing for a few years may improve
the level of education.  It would help with transparency without
running afoul of the confidentiality of contracts. Some
felt that a Last Call for some IAOC things is worthwhile, but other,
more mundane tasks don't need it.  A participant mentioned that the
IAOC should document the basis for a decision, rather than the mere
fact of it.



Staff and Volunteer Resource Issues {#staff}
-----------------------------------

Slide 8 of the slide deck {{IASA2-Workshop-Slides}} discussed the
following issues involving staff and volunteer resources:

* IAD workload is (much) more than a full-time job, but we have 
  one staff person allocated to it.
* IASA tasks touch on a wider variety of topics and require more 
  different kinds of expertise than 10 years ago (visa issues, 
  local social/political/health issues, new modes of fundraising, etc.), 
  but the job descriptions and skill sets of staff and volunteers do
  not always match these needs.
* Very few community members have the time, support, and interest to 
  stand for the IAOC (or even participate in administrative discussions, 
  unless something goes astray), and many who do are self-funding their work.

Much of the discussion at the workshops regarding staff and volunteer
issues focused on the IAOC committees. Committees allow the IAOC to
draw in expertise in a particular area, without burdening committee
members with the overall task of IAOC responsibility. One participant
observed that the function of the committees seems to go pretty well,
but sometimes scope and authority in relation to the IAOC are
unclear. Who's really in charge of the committee? Who is leading the
discussions and making decisions? What kind of decision is being made?
Who is supporting those decisions? A committee can make a
recommendation that is subject to easy reversal by the IAOC, which can
provide an undercurrent of doubt when discussions take place.

Although IAOC committees are listed on the IAOC website
(https://iaoc.ietf.org/committees.html) there is a lack of
documentation about how the committee participants are
chosen. Elaborating the expertise and skills needed can be a
challenge. For some teams it is necessary to have paid staff. Examples
of paid staff include the IETF lawyer, and the site visit and meeting
contract negotiation staff. The base membership for the legal
committee comes from the IAOC plus the lawyer. Last year the IAOC
asked for volunteers from the community and added to the legal
committee one of persons who stepped up.

To understand how the committees work, one needs to understand the
requirements and dependencies on contractors and other support
structures, which is complicated and not generally well
understood. What are the contractors doing? What effort is required to
serve as a volunteer? The committee composition of volunteers plus
paid staff may cause confusion about participants' roles, and also
cause control and accountability issues. Lack of encouragement for
participation in committees might be a disincentive for IAOC
participation. However, one workshop partipant was surprised at the
number of participants involved in IAOC committees.


Internal IAOC Organizational Issues {#IAOCorg}
-----------------------------------

Slide 11 of the slide deck {{IASA2-Workshop-Slides}} discussed the
following issues specific to internal IAOC organizational matters:

* The IAOC has 4 ex officio members (IETF Chair, IAB Chair, ISOC CEO, IAD (non-voting)), 
  and 5 appointed members. One of 5 members is appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees, 
  and is traditionally expected not to stand for IAOC Chair. This yields -
    * A small pool from which to select the IAOC Chair
    * A small pool from which to select the IETF Trust Chair
    * Very few (2, by the time you've appointed IAOC and Trust Chairs) "worker bees" for the IAOC
* Requiring that the IAOC and the IETF Trust be constituted by the same group of people 
  overloads the job responsibilities of both roles, narrows the pool of individuals 
  willing and able to serve on the IAOC, and creates the potential for conflicts in 
  cases where the creation of Trust policies requires IAOC oversight.
* Requiring that the IAB chair serve on the IAOC overloads the IAB Chair's job 
  responsibilities and narrows the pool of people willing and able to serve as IAB Chair. 
  The same may be true for the IETF Chair.

Some workshop participants wondered if better communication, for
instance, knowing about IAOC activities early enough to affect them,
would translate into more people wanting to participate in the
IAOC. Information about the IAOC can be made available in email and on
the website, but that may not inspire people who don't care about
administrative issues to volunteer. Having people spend time just on
the technical work would be a success, but relying on volunteers for
the IAOC's large volume of work may be unreasonable.

It was pointed out that populating the IAOC is difficult because is
there are so many leadership positions, and only those appointees from
the IESG, IAB, and the two appointed by NomCom can be Chair. One of
those four people will always be the Chair, and another of those four
will chair the IETF Trust. There is a tradition of the ISOC Board of
Trustees appointee not standing for chair, but that is not a
requirement, and the IAOC could move away from it. It's important that
the appointers choose people who have interest in chairing, otherwise
the pool gets smaller. A workshop participant said that they had heard
stories that the NomCom did not know what to look for when appointing
someone to the IAOC.

The ex officios bring much knowledge to the IAOC and they need to be
participants, but they don't have the time. A way to solve that is to
increase the regular membership of the IAOC. There needs to be a way
for the community to pick additional people.

The question was asked: to what extent is the IAOC an oversight body?
If the community wants the IAOC to be able to do more than provide the
thinnest layer of oversight, then it needs to revisit how to populate
the IAOC. In order to make any changes to the IAOC, the community
needs to understand the current roles and responsibilities of its
members.
 
The IETF Trust requires talent separate from the rest of the IAOC
tasks. Maybe it is no longer convenient that the IAOC and Trust are
together, given the IANA stewardship transition issues last
year. However, this is a secondary issue compared to other issues
raised during the workshops. When asked if the Trust could be smaller,
workshop participants responded that size was not an issue aside from
getting quorum occasionally. The size and composition of the IETF
Trust should be determined by its role, which needs to be
discussed. Currently, the IETF Trust currently has a light workload.
