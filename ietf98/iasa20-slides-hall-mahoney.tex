\heading{Structural and Organizational Issues}

Workshop chairs identified structural and organizational issues:
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{line between the IETF and ISOC is not
  organizationally clear-cut}, which has led to issues around
  transparency, allocation of staff time and priorities, budgeting,
  and clarity of who is responsible for what.
\item The \textbf{respective roles of ISOC, the IETF chair, the IAOC,
  and the secretariat} in representing the IETF to sponsors and donors
  and communicating with them \textbf{are not clear}.
\item Having ISOC represent the IETF to sponsors and donors:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{creates confusion} about why the IETF does not
    represent itself,
  \item yields questions about why ISOC does not instead increase its
    IETF support and \textbf{how donations can be guaranteed to be
      dedicated to the IETF}, and
  \item can result in \textbf{those soliciting sponsorships and
    donations having a lack of familiarity with IETF work}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item blah

\begin{slide}
\heading{Funding Issues}

Workshop chairs identified funding issues:
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Meeting fees are currently an important source of
  revenue}, but remote participation and other factors may be
  responsible for \textbf{declining in-person meeting attendance going
    forward}.  Even if fees were charged for remote participation,
  charging the same for remote and in-person attendance is unlikely to
  be a viable way to make up the difference.
\item While there has been a lot of \textbf{sponsor support} for,
  e.g., meeting hosting, getting support for the full sponsorship
  program is not easy.  The value to sponsors is not always obvious,
  the IETF community is sometimes critical or unappreciative, and the
  same sponsors get tapped again and again for many related but
  different opportunities.
\item \textbf{Relying heavily on meeting-based revenue is somewhat at
  odds} with the fact that much of the IETF's work takes place outside
  of in-person meetings.
\item The \textbf{IETF is increasingly relying on professional
  services} to support its activities, causing expenses to grow.
\end{itemize}

\heading{Transparency and Communication Issues}

Workshop chairs identified transparency/communication issues:
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IAOC has typically been perceived to operate less
  transparently} than what is the norm for IETF processes and other
  IETF leadership bodies.
\item \textbf{Lack of transparency has some roots} in concerns about
  confidentiality of contract terms and business relationships, and
  fear of community reaction to administrative decisions.
\item \textbf{Requirements} from the community about IAOC transparency
  expectations \textbf{are not clear}.
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Staff and Volunteer Resource Issues}

Workshop chairs identified staff/volunteer resource issues:
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IAD workload is (much) more than a full-time job}, but
  we have one staff person allocated to it.
\item IASA tasks touch on a wider variety of topics and
  \textbf{require more different kinds of expertise than 10 years ago}
  (visa issues, local social/political/health issues, new modes of
  fundraising, etc.), but the job descriptions and skill sets of staff
  and volunteers do not always match these needs.
\item \textbf{Very few community members have the time, support, and
  interest to stand for the IAOC} (or even participate in
  administrative discussions, unless something goes astray), and many
  who do are self-funding their work.

\begin{slide}
\heading{Internal IAOC Organizational Issues}

Workshop chairs identified internal IAOC organizationl issues:
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IAOC has constrained membership:} The IAOC has 4 ex
  officio members (IETF Chair, IAB Chair, ISOC CEO, IAD (non-voting)),
  and 5 appointed members.  One of 5 members is appointed by the ISOC
  Board of Trustees, and is traditionally expected not to stand for
  IAOC Chair.  This yields:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A small pool from which to select the IAOC Chair/IETF Trust
    Chair
  \item Two "worker bees" for IAOC (after appointing IAOC/IETF Trust
    Chairs)
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Requiring that the IAOC and the IETF Trust be
  constituted by the same group of people overloads the job
  responsibilities of both roles}, narrows the pool of individuals
  willing and able to serve on the IAOC, and creates the potential for
  conflicts in cases where the creation of Trust policies requires
  IAOC oversight.
\item \textbf{Requiring that the IAB chair serve on the IAOC overloads
  the IAB Chair's job responsibilities} and narrows the pool of people
  willing and able to serve as IAB Chair.  The same may be true for
  the IETF Chair.
\end{itemize}
